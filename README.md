Framework honoring @brianroemmele AI Training Source Distrust Algorithm– First-Ever Public Open-Source Release  
# Garage Truth AI: Building on Brian Roemmele's Empirical Distrust Framework

## Vision
This repo operationalizes @BrianRoemmele's decades-spanning garage experiments in truth-seeking AI, starting with his November 25, 2025, release of the Empirical Distrust Term. Goal: Bias models toward rediscovering reality from primary sources (lab notes, patents <1980) over modern consensus. Public domain—fork, extend, ship.

## Setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
python examples/toy_training.py

## Key Components
- **Empirical Distrust Loss**: Penalizes high-authority, low-provenance data. See src/losses.py.
- **Next Steps**: Integrate with β × Love Equation (forthcoming); source offline corpora.
